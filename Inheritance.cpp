    -> Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs.
    -> In C++ we can reuse a class and additional features to it.
    -> Reusing classes saves time and money.
    -> Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again.

    What is inheritance in C++?
        -> The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
        -> The existing class is called as the "Base Class".
        -> The new class which is inherited is called as the "Derived Class".

        -> There are different types of inheritance in C++:
            1. Single Inheritance - A Derived Class with only one Base Class.
            2. Multiple Inheritance - A Derived Class with more than one Base Class.
            3. Hierarchical Inheritance - Several Derived Classes from a singlr Base Class.
            4. Multilevel Inheritance - Deriving a Class from already Derived Class.
            5. Hybrid Inheritance - Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance 
                                  - A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
                                  - However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
